CAVV

# [](https://developer.powertranz.com/docs/integration-types#cavv)

CAVV (Cardholder Authentication Verification Value) or AAV (Authentication Verification Value) is a cryptographic value generated by issuing bank during the 3DS2 authentication process. It is used to verify the authenticity of the cardholder's authentication. The issuing bank creates the CAVV based on various factors and data exchanged during the 3DS2 flow. This CAVV is then sent back to the merchant as part of the 3DS2 response.

Liability Shift

# [](https://developer.powertranz.com/docs/integration-types#liability-shift)

Liability shift refers to the transfer of financial responsibility for fraudulent transactions during online payments. When a transaction is authenticated using 3DS2, and if it is later found to be fraudulent, the liability for the unauthorized charge shifts from the merchant to the cardholder's bank (card issuer). This means the card issuer will be responsible for refunding the cardholder and covering the financial loss, instead of the merchant. The liability shift helps protect merchants from losses due to fraud and encourages them to adopt 3DS2 for secure online transactions.
